Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:  

It is  an applied engineering discipline which uses  a set methodologies which process buillding, testing and maintening of applications to solve realtime 
using a systematic approach.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

It is a systematic process of developing applications and software systems which will be designed, tested using applied engineering principles methods, and 
tools  that will help with high maintenance of software applications.

It differs from a traditional programming because it uses a systematic approach structure which includes analysing,design,coding,testing. Often follows methodologies and processes such as Agile and Waterfall. It emphasises on quality and long-term perspective. unlike traditional
programming which focuses primarily on writing codes to solve a specific problem. While software engineering takes a holistic approach by 
considering scalability and maintenance. It also differs from software development lifecycle (SDLC).As it isn a framework that describe the 
stages involved in developing of a software.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

>Requirement gathering: identifying and documanting of software requirements,understanding end-user needs.

>Analsis: gathered requirements are analyzed in detail ensuring inconsistances are resolved using clarity and completeness.

>Design: creating high level and detailed design plan based on the requirements gathered in analysis phase(interfaces and algorithms).

>Implentation(coding): writing of codes and implementing specifications using excecutable codes using a programming language.

>Testing: conducting of various tests to ensure there are no defects or bugs.Using of testing techniques(intergration and system testing).

>Deployment: releasing of software to user or customer after it was thoroughly tested and validated.This includes installations and configurations.

>Maintenance: providing ongoing sytems support and maintenance addressing bugs and system issues and making enhancements and updates when needed.

(Agile model) it is an approach which focuses on flexibility,collaboration.it is iterative and incremental.

(Waterfall model) it is a sequential approach with set phases. design,implemenations,testing.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

When comparing Agile and Waterfall in different key aspects, Agile in (approach)breaks projects into small iterations which delivers a working subset of software. emphasising on flexibility,adaptability while Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach. in which design,implimenation, testing are completed before moving on. 

Agile model is adaptive to changing requirements and priorities through regular feetback. While Waterfall model involves limited customer /client input which is normally at the end of the project which leads to delayed validation.

Agile manages and identify risks and addresses them early in the project in contrast with Waterfall tending to have less effective risk management. Risks are identified in later stages of development resulting to costly changes.

Waterfall model is best for  projects with specified requirements  and minimum expectations and changes while Agile model is preferred for projects where flexibility and customer inputs and collaboration are crucial.


Requirements Engineering: What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirement engineering is the process of analyzing, documanting and managing of software system involving what users, customers,developers need from the system. has clear testable requirements.

The Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) is structured with different stages namely;planning,analysis,design,implemantation,testing,deployment and maintenance.

The importance of software design principles
>there are fundamental guidelines which guide the process of designing software systems. playing an important role in scalability, flexibility, reusability, performance and quality. by applying these principles effectively, helps meet needs of stakeholders as developers.



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

concept of modularity in software design refers to implimanting the breakdowns of software system into modules that each will be responsible for a specific functionality or feature. They are independently designed to be tested and maintained separately without impacting the whole systems.

it improves scalability by enabling indepented development providing architecture that adapt change in requirements, with design principles that are essential forbuilding, adapting scalable software systems.



Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

>Unit testing: focus is on individual components (functions, methods or classes).makes sure that unit performs as expected and meets required functionality. test cases are written to cover edge cases and error conditions. uses testing framework like python.

> intergration testing: testing interactions and interfaces between intergrated units and modules. it varifies that individual units work together as intended and intergrate correctly. for larger components test cases focuses in testing data flows API calls and interactions between modules. 

>acceptance testing: validating software againsts the business requirements and user expectations. test are derived from user stories. it uses manual testing.

Testing is crucial in software development ensuring reliability and user satisfaction while version control system enables collaborative development and effective management.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version Control System(vcs) are software tools that enables developers to manage change to source codes, documents
, files in collaborative development environment.

Examples of version control systems.
>Git: a distributed version of vcs known for its speed, flexibility and branching capabilities. allowing multiple working on the same project without conflict. it is used widely.(github and gitlab).

>subsersion(SVN) a centralized vcs which stores files and directories in central repository. supports branching tagging and merging. it is popular in enterprises environment

>mercurial: a distributed vcs fot large-scale projects. offers high performance server architecture. used in gaming and automotive.

each of these vcs offer different features and maybe used according to specific requirements and preferences.



Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

The role of a sofware manager: overseeing and guiding development of a project from start to finish. serves to lead and offer problem solving throughout the project cycle. 

the key responsibility 
>Project planning: defining of project scope, timeline amd resources required.

>Team management: lead and motivate the project team, provide guidance and support. ensuring a smooth collaborative and productive team environment

>Quality assurance: ensuring software meets specific requirements,functions as expected.monitor quality of project.

Challenges faced in managing software:
>Resource constrainsts: limited avaliability of resources, budget and allocation.

>Technical complexity: software projects involving a complex technology leading to implementation issues , delays and quality.

>Schedule pressures: pressure to meet aggressive deadline, resulting to a rushed development and compromised quality.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

software maintencance : refers to the  activities involving in modifying,updating of software application or system after they have been deployed.

Different types of maintenance activities.
>Corrective maintenance : involves identifying and fixing defects,bugs,errors in the software in operational use.

>Adaptive maintenance: focuses on making changes to the software to accomodate change e.g updating of operating system OS, and hardware configurations.

>Perfective maintencance: optimizing the software tp improve performance,efficiency and usability(adding a new feature and redesign).

>Emergency Maintenance: involves addressing critical issues and outages that require immediate attension to restore functionality of software (applying of patches).


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

ethical issues
>privacy concerns: handling of user data(storage, usage and protection).

>security vulnerability: ignoring of secirity protocol leading to hacks and data breaches.

>Transparency and accountabiliy: not disclosing how the software works and its potential consequences.

>social responsibility: consideration of social impacts by software developers (perpetuating harmful stereotype) 

>bias in algoriths: writing of algorithms that discriminate based on gender, age, race and other factors that can lead to unfair outcomes.


software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by ensuring continuous learning on updated ethical guides amd practices. regularily review ethical codes and participate in ethical training. enusre user privacy by prioritizing personal data protection through the develoment cycle.
